# Clustering-geolocation-data-

This project is inspired from coursera's guided project.

We have taxi rank locations, and want to define key clusters of these taxis where we can build service stations for all taxis operating in that region.

## Project Outline

- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visualizing Geographical Data
- Clustering Strength / Performance Metric
- K-Means Clustering
- DBSCAN
- HDBSCAN
- Addressing Outliers
